### Basic info:
- the init script needs to be in ~/.config/river folder which you should create if it isn't there already. you might as well put scripts folder and other things in there too.
- the waybar should also be in ~/.config/waybar

### Absolute minimum needed
yay -S river waybar

- you also need to install the layout generator, otherwise uncomment it, and comment in the #riverctl default-layout rivertile

- there are bunch more programs needed, but currently I haven't listed all of them, but it can be followed from the script.
